Due to excessive usage in the past, your event throughput in the ${workspaceName} Workspace is currently throttled to ${throttled}%. This means ${
    100 - (throttled || 0)
  }% of events are being dropped.

To restore full event flow, please consider upgrading your plan.

You can update your billing here: https://use.jitsu.com/${workspaceSlug}/settings/billing.
