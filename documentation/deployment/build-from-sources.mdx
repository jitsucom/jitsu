# Build from sources

### Prerequisites

**Jitsu** is written primarily in Go with the frontend written in JavaScript.

To install the required pre-requisites see the following guides:

* [Installing Go \(&gt;=1.16\)](https://golang.org/doc/install)
* [Installing npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
* [Installing yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install)

<Hint>
    Please make sure your version of Go is > 1.16 with the following command:
    <code inline="true">go version</code>.
</Hint>


### Cloning source code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jitsucom/jitsu.git
cd jitsu
```

Make build scripts executable:

```bash
chmod +x local-build-server.sh && \
chmod +x local-build-configurator.sh && \
chmod +x local-build-jitsu.sh && \
```

### Building Jitsu Server

Building **Jitsu Server** is simple, just run:

```bash
./local-build-server.sh -d false
```

`-d false` skips docker image build.

If build is successful, all artifacts will be placed inside the `./server/build/dist` directory:

```bash
$ ls -l ./server/build/dist
-rwxr-xr-x  1 vklmn  staff  30723620 Aug  6 15:58 eventnative
drwxr-xr-x  5 vklmn  staff       160 Aug  6 15:58 web
```

### Run Jitsu Server

`./eventnative` is the main application binary; `web` contains static files \(JS and HTML\).
Application doesn't require config file, but it will be mostly useless to run without config. You can generate config file on [Cloud.Jitsu](https://cloud.jitsu.com/cfg_download)
or create a new one according to [Configuration documentation](/docs/configuration).

Run the application with the following:

Run the application with configuration file using `-cfg` parameter:

```bash
./eventnative -cfg /path/to/eventnative.yaml
```

The configuration might be one of the [described formats](/docs/deployment/configuration-source). For example, run with [Raw JSON configuration source](/docs/deployment/configuration-source#raw-json):

```json
./eventnative -cfg '{"server":{"name":"test_instance", "auth":"token1"}}'
```

### Building Jitsu Configurator

For building **Jitsu Configurator** just run:

```bash
./local-build-configurator.sh -d false
```

`-d false` skips docker image build.

If build is successful, all artifacts will be placed inside the `./configurator/build/dist` directory:

```bash
$ ls -l ./server/build/dist
-rwxr-xr-x  1 vklmn  staff  50602019 Aug  6 15:58 configurator
drwxr-xr-x  5 vklmn  staff       608 Aug  6 15:58 web
```

### Run Jitsu Configurator

`./configurator` is the configurator UI backend application binary; `web` contains static Configurator UI files \(JS and HTML\).
Application requires config file. You can create one according to [Configuration documentation](/docs/configurator-configuration).

Run the application with configuration file using `-cfg` parameter:

```bash
./configurator -cfg /path/to/configurator.yaml
```
