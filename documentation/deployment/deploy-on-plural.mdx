# Deploy on Plural

[Plural](https://www.plural.sh/) is a free, open-source tool that enables you to deploy Jitsu on Kubernetes with the cloud provider of your choice. Plural is a unified application deployment platform that makes it easy to run open-source software on Kubernetes. It aims to make applications as portable as possible, without sacrificing the ability for the users to own the applications they desire to use.

## Getting Started

First, create an account on [https://app.plural.sh](https://app.plural.sh). This is only to track your installations and allow for the delivery of automated upgrades, you will not be asked to provide any infrastructure credentials or sensitive information.

Then, install the Plural CLI by following steps 1, 2, and 3 of the instructions [here](https://docs.plural.sh/getting-started).

You'll need a Git repository to store your Plural configuration in. This will contain the Helm charts, Terraform config, and Kubernetes manifests that Plural will autogenerate for you.

You have two options:
- Run `plural init` in any directory to let Plural initiate an OAuth workflow to create a Git repo for you.
- Create a Git repo manually, clone it down and run `plural init` inside it.

Running `plural init` will start a configuration wizard to configure your Git repo and your cloud provider for use with Plural. You're now ready to install Jitsu on your Plural repo.

## Installing Jitsu

To find the console bundle name for your cloud provider, run:

```bash
plural bundle list jitsu
```

Now, all you need to do is run the install command to add it to your workspace:

```bash
plural bundle install jitsu jitsu-aws
```

Plural's Jitsu distribution currently has support for AWS, GCP and Azure ready to go, so feel free to pick whichever best fits your infrastructure.

The CLI will prompt you to choose whether you want to use Plural OIDC. [OIDC](https://openid.net/connect/) allows you to login to the applications you host on Plural with your login to [app.plural.sh](https://app.plural.sh), acting as an SSO provider.

To generate the configuration and deploy your infrastructure, run:

```bash
plural build
plural deploy --commit "deploying jitsu"
```

<Hint>
    Deploys will generally take 10-20 minutes, based on your cloud provider.
</Hint>

## Installing the Plural Console

To make management of your installation as simple as possible, we recommend installing the Plural Console.  The console provides tools to manage resource scaling, receiving automated upgrades, dashboards tailored to your Jitsu installation, and log aggregation. This can be done using the exact same process as above, using AWS as an example:

```bash
plural bundle install console console-aws
plural build
plural deploy --commit "deploying the console too"
```

## Accessing your Jitsu Installation

Now, head over to `jitsu.YOUR_SUBDOMAIN.onplural.sh` to access the Jitsu UI.

## Accessing your Console Installation

To monitor and manage your Jitsu installation, head over to the Plural Console at `console.YOUR_SUBDOMAIN.onplural.sh`.

## Uninstalling Jitsu

To bring down your Plural installation of Jitsu at any time, run:

```bash
plural destroy jitsu
```

To bring your entire Plural deployment down, run:

```bash
plural destroy
```
