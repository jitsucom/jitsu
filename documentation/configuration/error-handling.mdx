# Error Handling and Retries

**Jitsu** supports sending events and re-sending them at failures.

##  Configuration

```yaml
server:
  ...
  streaming_retry_delay_minutes: 1 # Optional. Default value is 1
  error_retry_period_hours: 24 # Optional. Default value is 24
log:
  ...
  rotation_min: 5 # Optional. Default value is 5
...
destinations:
  ...
  destination_id:
    ...
    data_layout:
      ...
      # Positive value overrides server option for destination
      error_retry_period_hours: 0 # Optional. Default value is 0
```

## Batch mode

**Jitsu** receives a lot of events. All of them are saved into a file system.
Every `log.rotation_min` minutes **Jitsu** parses saved files with events and tries to send them to destinations.
If an event was sent correctly it will be archived into a special folder with successful events. Otherwise, **Jitsu** tries to resend it at the next uploading iteration.
If an event cannot be sent for any reason during `server.error_retry_period_hours` hours **Jitsu** stops resending an event and archives it into a special folder with unsuccessful events.

## Streaming mode

**Jitsu** receives an event and tries to send it to destinations.
If an event was sent correctly it will be archived into a special folder with successful events. Otherwise, **Jitsu** tries to resend it at the next uploading iteration that happens every `server.streaming_retry_delay_minutes` minutes.
If an event cannot be sent for any reason during `server.error_retry_period_hours` hours **Jitsu** stops resending an event and archives it into a special folder with unsuccessful events.
Any destination supports local `destinations.destination_id.data_layout.error_retry_period_hours` option that overrides global `server.error_retry_period_hours` option.
