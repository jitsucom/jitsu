# Table Names and Filters

**Jitsu** supports splitting events stream into different tables in DWH based on event JSON payload. It works by applying [JavaScript functions](/docs/configuration/javascript-functions) to incoming JSON objects. It can select a table name or pass a constant or even filter certain events from the destination. It is configured in the destination section and each destination has its own rules.

See also [JavaScript Transform](/docs/configuration/javascript-transform) for full event transformation using JavaScript

## **Table Name Selection**

By default table name will be `events` constant. It can be overridden in several ways:

Constant table name. In this case, all incoming events for `destination_1` will be stored in a single table with `constant` name.

```yaml
destinations:
  destination_1:
    data_layout:
      table_name_template: 'constant'
```

Table names are based on field values.

```yaml
destinations:
  destination_1:
    data_layout:
      #tables will be created with 'event_type' names
      table_name_template: '$.event_type'

      #or
      #tables will have 'event_type_YYYY_MM' format based on 'event_type' and date
      table_name_template: '`${_.event_type}_${_._timestamp.Format("2006_01")}`'

```

<Hint>
    Timestamp formatting is based on <a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18486255/98962749-fd5ae480-2517-11eb-9448-93aafdf6f97f.png">GO lang time layouts</a>.

## Events Filtering

`table_name_template` might be used for filtering certain events from the destination.
<Hint>
    If <code inline={true}>table_name_template</code> returns an empty string, `null` or `false` then the event will be skipped.
    Use <a href="/docs/other-features/admin-endpoints#apiv1templatesevaluate">Jitsu Template Evaluation endpoint</a> for testing your code.
</Hint>

For example all `pageview` events might be skipped:

```yaml
destinations:
  destination_1:
    data_layout:
      table_name_template: '$.event_type=="pageview" ? "" : $.event_type' #JavaScript

```

Expressions might be more complex. For example, keep only conversion events
\(skip other\) in case when a user isn't Google Analytics known user:

```yaml
destinations:
  destination_1:
    data_layout:
      table_name_template: |
            if ($.event_type == "conversion") {
                //only for conversion events
                if (!$.ids?.ga) {
                    //no ga id present
                    return $.event_type
                }
            }
            return ""
```
