# Application Metrics

**Jitsu** supports [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) as a metrics destination.
It uses the official [Go client library](https://github.com/prometheus/client_golang). Metrics are available
under `/prometheus?token=$admin_token` endpoint with admin token authorization
(see [how to configure admin_token](/docs/other-features/admin-endpoints)). In addition, this library collects system
metrics. It's suitable to use the official [Grafana dashboard](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/6671) template for
monitoring them.

### Configuration

By default metrics collection is disabled. For enabling it put the following keys in **Jitsu** YAML configuration:

```yaml
server:
  admin_token: your_admin_token
  metrics:
    prometheus:
      enabled: true
      auth: true
      endpoint: prometheus
    
destinations:
...    
```

| `eventnative.destinations.events` | Counter | **source\_id**, **destination\_id** | Amount of successful written events |
| `eventnative.destinations.errors` | Counter | **source\_id**, **destination\_id** | Amount of failed events |

#### Labels

| Label | Description |
