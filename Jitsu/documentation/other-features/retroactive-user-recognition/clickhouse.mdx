# Retroactive User Recognition on Clickhouse

Retroactive User Recognition feature needs to update data that was already loaded to a data warehouse
Clickhouse by its nature doesn't support `UPDATE` queries, but it provides different solutions with important specifics.

## Data Deduplication

Retroactive User Recognition on Clickhouse works with tables using [ReplacingMergeTree](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/engines/table-engines/mergetree-family/replacingmergetree/) or ReplicatedReplacingMergeTree engines
and relies on its data deduplication mechanism.

<Hint>
Data deduplication occurs in the background at an unknown time, so you canâ€™t plan for it.
Some data may remain unprocessed.
</Hint>

Basically speaking, that means that `SELECT` query will contain some duplicated rows when query time period intersects with
User Recognition anonymous events TTL period ([Read more on TTL](/docs/other-features/retroactive-user-recognition/redis-optimization))

To avoid duplicated data in results you need to use `FINAL` modifier after table name:

```sql
select * from events_with_user_recognition FINAL order by _timestamp desc;
```

When `FINAL` is specified, ClickHouse fully merges the data before returning the result and thus performs all data transformations that happen during merges for the given table engine.

## Configuration

When Jitsu creates table in Clickhouse it automatically setups table engine compatible with Retroactive User Recognition.

If you need Retroactive User Recognition to work with existing table you need to make sure that correct `ENGINE` and sorting key (`ORDER BY`)
are set for table:

`ENGINE = ReplacingMergeTree` or `ENGINE = ReplicatedReplacingMergeTree`<br/>
`ORDER_BY eventn_ctx_event_id`

Otherwise, User Recognition needs to be turned off for that destination to avoid data duplication.

Example:
```sql
CREATE TABLE jitsu.events_with_user_recognition
(
    `_timestamp` DateTime,
    `api_key` String,
    `event_type` String,
    ...
)
ENGINE = ReplacingMergeTree
PARTITION BY toYYYYMM(_timestamp)
ORDER BY eventn_ctx_event_id
SETTINGS index_granularity = 8192
```
