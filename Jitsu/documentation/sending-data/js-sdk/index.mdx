# Jitsu JS SDK

Jitsu JavaScript SDK allows you to send data to Jitsu from web-application. There're two ways
how to embed Jitsu into your application:

 * Using [npm (or yarn) package manager](/docs/sending-data/js-sdk/package). This is a preferred way for applications written from scratch with
a frameworks such as React, Vue, Angular etc.
 * Using [html snippet](/docs/sending-data/js-sdk/snippet) (also known as 'Pixel' or 'Tracking' code). This is a preferred way for websites and
applications built with no-code tools such as Webflow, Wix, Wordpress etc
 * Also, it's [possible to use Jitsu react hooks](/docs/sending-data/js-sdk/react) to simplify collecting data from React applications. Those hooks
assume that you use react-router.
 * For server-side tracking, read [Node.js  guide](/docs/sending-data/node-js)
 * Examples and bindings for other popular frameworks are coming

<Hint>
    We have a deprecated version of JS SDK with non-compatible API. If you're looking to migrate to a new API,
