# Javascript Configuration

### Initialization

Both in npm and standalone mode, EventNative accepts the following parameters.

| Parameter | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| key *  | **Required.** API key ([How to get API key](/docs/configuration/authorization)) |
| tracking_host | If not set, EventNative will do the best attempt to detect it automatically |
| cookie_name | Name of tracking cookie (`__eventn_id` by default) |
| ga_hook | If set to true, EventNative will automatically listen to Google Analytics events and collect them.  |
| segment_hook | If set to true, EventNative will automatically listen to Segment's [analytics.js](https://github.com/segmentio/analytics.js/) event and collect them.  |
| randomize_url | If set to true, EventNative will send events on a dynamic endpoint. It allows avoiding ad blockers. |

<Hint>
    All parameters with documentation can be in <a href="https://github.com/jitsucom/eventnative/blob/master/web/src/types.ts" >the interface definition file</a>. This file is also bundled with <a href="/docs/sending-data/javascript-reference/npm-or-yarn">npm package</a>.
</Hint>

### Tracking

If EventNative is [not configured to listen to Google Analytics or Segment events](/docs/sending-data/javascript-reference/events-interception), you need to track these events manually. Unlike other analytics providers, EventNative is schema-less by design. You can send any parameters you wish without having to reconfigure the backend.

`id()` sets the properties of the user (such as `name`, `e-mail`, `internal id` â€” any parameters are accepted)

```json
eventN.id({
    "name": "Man with No Name",
    "email": "thegoods@western.com",
    "id": "6"
})
```

By default, a `user_identification` event will be sent. However, it can be changed by setting the second parameter to `true`.

```javascript
eventN.id({...}, true);
```

`eventN.track()` is used to record any event happens with user

<CodeInTabs>
    <CodeTab title="Syntax" lang="javascript">
        {"eventN.track('{event_name}', {...event data})"}
    </CodeTab>
    <CodeTab title="Example" lang="javascript">
        {`
        eventN.track('product_page_view', {
            product_id: '1e48fb70-ef12-4ea9-ab10-fd0b910c49ce',
            product_price: 399,
            price_currency: 'USD'
        });
        `}
    </CodeTab>
</CodeInTabs>

<Hint>
    If <code inline="true">id()</code> has been called prior to <code inline="true">track()</code>, all user details will be included.
    Also, do not include parameters such as page URL and user agent. EventNative collects this automatically!
