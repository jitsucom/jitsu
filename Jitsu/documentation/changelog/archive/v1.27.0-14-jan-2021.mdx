# 1.27.0 - 14 Jan 2021

EventNative `1.27.0` is out! This release is dedicated to [**Retroactive User Recognition**](/docs/other-features/retroactive-user-recognition)**!**

Knowledge about where a user comes from is important. Especially it's true for companies using paid channels (advertising, social) for user acquisition. Understanding what user done before the conversion event is a crucial part of analysing efficiency of such channel.

EventNative can change the past starting from 1.27.0! Once user's identity is known (as a result of registration or any other type of conversion), the special piece of code amends all previous events made by this user and assigns a user id to all of them. Thus, an exact path to conversion of the user is known!
