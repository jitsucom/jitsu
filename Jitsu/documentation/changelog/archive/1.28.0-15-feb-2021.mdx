# 1.28.0 - 15 Feb 2021

EventNative `1.28.1` is out! Here are the biggest changes:

### Singer bridge

[Singer](https://singer.io) is an command-line open-source data synronization framework. Singer operates so-called "taps" — an API data extraction scripts. EventNative supports singer taps as sources for pulling data. Each tap is automatically installed in [python virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html). You won't need to worry about pip packages compatibility!

### New sources: GoogleAnalytics, Facebook Marketing and Redis

We added 3 new sources: EventNative now can pull data from Redis, Google Analytics and Facebook Marketing API which is very useful for measuring online ads ROI. Read more about configuration of those sources:

* [**Google Analytics** ](/docs/sources-configuration/google-analytics)»
* [**Facebook Marketing API »**](/docs/sources-configuration/facebook-marketing) »
* [**Redis**](/docs/sources-configuration/redis) »

### Facebook Pixel API as a destination

EventNative can send data to Facebook Pixel API through backend. It's similar to server-2-server [Google Analytics](/docs/destinations-configuration/google-analytics) destinations.

The end-point allows to test how event JSON is mapped and sent to destination. [**Read more**](/docs/other-features/dry-run-events) »
