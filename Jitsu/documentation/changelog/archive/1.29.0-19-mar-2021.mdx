# 1.29.0 - 19 Mar 2021

Jitsu `1.29.0` is out! Here are the biggest changes:

### Retroactive users recognition with Redshift
Jitsu can change the past starting now with Redshift as well! Once user's identity is known (as a result of registration or any other type of conversion), the special piece of code amends all previous events made by this user and assigns a user id to all of them. Thus, an exact path to conversion of the user is known!

### Automatic sources synchronization
Jitsu supports cron style schedule configuration for automatic sources synchronization! You still can initiate source synchronization manually (by sending HTTP request).
