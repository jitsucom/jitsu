# Extending Jitsu

With [Jitsu SDK](https://github.com/jitsucom/jitsu) you can implement extension for Jitsu using Typescript. Each extension
is a separate node package that could be published to public or private npm repository. Jitsu server downloads extension code and executes in within internal
V8 JS virtual machine

Extensions can have several purposes:

 * **[Destination](/docs/extending/destination-plugins)**. An external service where Jitsu distributes
incoming events based on configuration. A good example of the destination extension will be [Mixpanel](https://github.com/jitsucom/jitsu-mixpanel).
 * **[Source](/docs/extending/source-plugins)**. Source (or pull-source) is typically a service or platform from which Jitsu pulls the data. Later, the data is being
sent to destination database or data-warehouse. See the list of [all supported source](https://cloud.jitsu.com/sources).
