# Docker compose

The easiest way to start Jitsu locally is docker-compose. Just few clicks

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jitsucom/jitsu.git
cd jitsu
```

Add permission for writing log files:

```bash
#Ubuntu/Mac OS
chmod -R 777 compose-data/
```

For running `latest` version use:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Visit `http://localhost:8000/configurator` after the build is complete.


**Jitsu** provides docker-compose that contains `@jitsucom/jitsu` docker image and Redis.

<Hint>
    Docker compose should not be used in production. Please, take a look at{' '}
    <a href="/docs/deployment">deployment architecture page</a> and a <a href="/docs/deployment/scale">Jitsu scaling manual</a>
