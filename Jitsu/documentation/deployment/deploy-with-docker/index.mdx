# Deploying with Docker

## Which Docker Image do I need?

![Jitsu Docker Images](/img/docs/jitsu-docker-images.png)

Jitsu consists from two services: Configurator (aka Control Plan, optional) and Server (aka Data Plane). With each release,
we build 3 docker images:

* `@jitsucom/server` contains only Server (see the image [on docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/jitsucom/server))
* `@jitsucom/configurator` contains only Configurator (see the image [on docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/jitsucom/configurator))
* `@jitsucom/jitsu` (aka Joint Image) contains both Server and Configurator (see the image [on docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/jitsucom/jitsu))

`@jitsu/configurator` is an optional component. Jitsu Server can be configured with [YML file](/docs/configuration).

[Heroku deployment](/docs/deployment/deploy-on-heroku) users `@jitsucom/jitsu` under the hood. [Docker compose](/docs/deployment/deploy-with-docker#run-dockercompose)
uses Jitsu joint image as well. If you're getting started with Jitsu, or operate Jitsu under moderate (`<10 RPS`) load, use `@jitsucom/jitsu` image,
otherwise consider deploying `@jitsucom/server` and `@jitsucom/configurator` separately.

Also, Jitsu requires Redis. Configurator uses Redis for storing Jitsu configuration, user accounts and so on. Server uses Redis for
coordination, synchronization and caching. [Docker compose](/docs/deployment/deploy-with-docker#run-dockercompose) already
includes Redis

You can try Configurator UI at [Jitsu.Cloud](https://cloud.jitsu.com). Jitsu.Cloud will allow you to download configuration YML file that
could be used for standalone Jitsu Server deployment.

See overview of deployment options below

## Docker Compose

<LargeLink title="Deploy with Docker Compose" href="/docs/deployment/deploy-with-docker/docker-compose" />

The fastest option (one-click deploy). Perfect, to test Jitsu locally. Won't scale for production usage

## Joint Image

<LargeLink title="@jitsucom/jitsu Joint Image" href="/docs/deployment/deploy-with-docker/docker-compose" />

`@jitsucom/jitsu` docker image (see below). Can scale, however for high loaded system Configurator and Server separation
is advised

## Deploying Jitsu Server and Configurator separately

This method requires a separate deployment of `@jitsucom/configurator` and `@jitsucom/server`:

<LargeLink title="Configurator Deployment" href="/docs/deployment/deploy-with-docker/jitsu-configurator" />
<LargeLink title="Server Deployment" href="/docs/deployment/deploy-with-docker/jitsu-server" />
