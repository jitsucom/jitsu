# Deploy on Kubernetes

Jitsu is 100% compatible with Kubernetes. There're a number of Jitsu k8s deployment operating at large scale.
However, there are a few issues:

 * We don't maintain an official Helm chart. There's a chart maintained my [@viggin543](https://github.com/viggin543/jitsu_helm_chart); [another chart](https://github.com/pluralsh/plural-artifacts/tree/main/jitsu/helm/jitsu)
is available as part of [Plural deployment](/docs/deploment/deploy-on-plural)
 * There's an issue with running Airbyte connectors on k8s. Ideally, Jitsu should have an option to run Airbyte tasks on k8s cluster directly,
but it's not implemented yet. Jitsu can start Airbyte containers as DinD (Docker in Docker), but there are some issues with that. See [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/jitsucom/jitsu/issues/863)
