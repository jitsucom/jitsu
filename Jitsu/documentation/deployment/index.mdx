# Deploying Jitsu

[**Jitsu**](https://github.com/jitsucom/jitsu) â€” is an open-source data collection platform. We built
our platform incredibly easy to deploy and use. Below, we have several step-by-step guides outlining
how to set up Jitsu on a variety of different environments  with the easiest being [**Heroku deploy**](/docs/deployment/deploy-on-heroku)
and [**Docker deploy**](/docs/deployment/deploy-with-docker). We don't [support Kubernetes officially yet](/docs/deployment/k8s),
but we partnered with [**Plural deploy**](/docs/deployment/deploy-on-plural) to bring Jitsu to k8s
