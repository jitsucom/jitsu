# Configuration UI

Most of the Jitsu features can be configured with Configuration UI, also called Jitsu Configurator.

Internally, Jitsu Configurator prepares a [configuration file for Jitsu Server](/docs/configuration), so
all features available in UI can be configured without it.

To access Jitsu Configurator, please make sure you deployed `@jitsu/configurator` along with `@jitsu/server`, or
[joint image](/docs/deployment/deploy-with-docker/joint-image) which contains Server and Configurator both.

Please see a [deployment section of our documentation](/docs/deployment/deploy-with-docker) for more details

## Jitsu Cloud

[Jitsu.Cloud](https://cloud.jitsu.com) â€” a hosted version of Jitsu is powered by Jitsu.Configurator.
