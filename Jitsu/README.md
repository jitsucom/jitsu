**[Jitsu](https://jitsu.com/?utm_source=gh)** is an open source high-performance data collection service. It can:

* Capture events your application generates and stream to Data Warehouse;
* Pull data from APIs and save it to Data Warehouse

## Quick Start

Two easiest ways to start Jitsu are Heroku deployment and local docker-compose. 

### 1-click Heroku deploy
It may take up to 5 minutes for Heroku to install environment. 
After that you can visit `<your_app_name>.herokuapp.com`

<a href="https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/jitsucom/jitsu"><img src="https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg" width="250px" /></a>

### Docker Compose
Start Jitsu using docker-compose:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jitsucom/jitsu.git
cd jitsu
```

Add permission for writing log files:

```bash
#Ubuntu/Mac OS
chmod -R 777 compose-data/
```

For running `latest` version use:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Note: `latest` image will be downloaded and started.

Visit `http://localhost:8000/configurator` after the build is complete.
